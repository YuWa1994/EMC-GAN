# EMC-GAN for condition monitoring with emerging new classes
Welcome to the GitHub repository for EMC-GAN, a Python implementation of a GAN-based method designed to address the challenges posed by Streaming Data with Emerging New Classes (SENC) in condition monitoring of rotating machinery.

## Research Manuscripts ##
We have conducted extensive research on this method, and the results have been documented in the following manuscripts:

## Brief Introduction ##
The primary focus of this repository is the application of our proposed EMC-GAN method on two benchmark datasets, which are:
* Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center
* Konstruktions- und Antriebstechnik (KAt) - Bearing Data Center

The core implementation of the method can be found in the 'GAN_for_NEC.py' file, while the network architectures utilized in the process are available in the 'GAN_Nets.py' file.

To run the EMC-GAN method on the provided datasets, simply execute either 'run_EMCGAN_Kat.py' for the KAt dataset or 'run_EMCGAN_CWRU.py' for the CWRU dataset.
